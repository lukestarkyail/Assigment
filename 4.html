        <p>
            The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is designed to help you work, study or migrate to a country where English is the native language. This includes countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and USA.

            Your ability to listen, read, write and speak in English will be assessed during the test. IELTS is graded on a scale of 1-9.  
            
            IELTS is jointly owned by the British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and Cambridge English.
