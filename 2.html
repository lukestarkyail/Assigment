        <p>
            The IGCSE is based on the British curriculum (GCSE) but adapted for a more internationally-focused student body.  Assessments are done mainly by examination through the exam board of the schoolâ€™s choice. The most well-known are Cambridge Assessment International Education and Edexcel. The Cambridge exam board offers over 70 subjects, including 30 languages. The aim is to be as inclusive as possible to students from a wide variety of linguistic backgrounds. This allows them to continue studying their mother tongue. The IGCSE allows for differing levels of ability by offering both Core and Extended curriculum papers in some subjects.
