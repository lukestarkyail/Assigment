  <h1>GED</h1>

<p>
The GED was originally an acronym for the Tests of General Educational Development, but since 2011 they just use the term GED. The GED test is a series of four subject tests a person can take to demonstrate their high school academic knowledge. It is equal to American Grade (12) education. I'm Kyail Nay La who is going to take the GED exam next year. I think, it is a perfect timing that I will be 16 next years since in most states and jurisdictions, anyone 18 and older is eligible to take the General Education Development, or GED high school equivalency test. However, most states also allow anyone 16 and older to take the GED if they have an age waiver and other types of documentation. 
     GEDÂ® exam is made up of 4 subjects, broken into separate exams: Mathematical Reasoning, Reasoning Through Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science. After passing GED exam, you can study at forgein university. Especially, US and Thiland but most of the counntry acept with GED. You can also check the university which acept with GED at the link given.
